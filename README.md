This program will let you add a circle of whatever size you want to a .mp4 file and will regenerate the video with that circle. 


Please go to Line 78, and paste the pathway to your .mp4 in the text between the quotation marks - e.g. "/Users/primalkarma/Desktop/OSL Red Light July 25th 2023/NoneT1.mp4"
